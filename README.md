# Project Name
Weekend SQL To Do List

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description
In this project, I will be creating a "To Do List" webpage that will allow a user to input a task into the screen and then be able to view the list of activities and mark whether a task was completed or not.  The user will then have the option to remove that task from the screen. The task(s) will be stored in a database (SQL).

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
